# s_and_t_cpp_course
This course is online and free. I have provided solutions for some of the problems.

Here is the [course website](https://classes.mst.edu/compsci1570/)

Thank you [Clayton Price](https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/price/) for providing this material for free.

## note
I have completed this course for teaching purposes. 
I am following the assignments along with c++ material and thus
do not make use of c++ constructs that have not been covered by the
material
